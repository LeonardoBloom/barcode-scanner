# Introduction

This is an app I developed in Expo Go with React Native as a prototype for a logistics company's warehouse management. 

The app's objective is to scan items received using a barcode scanner, where it is then added to a Pallet, which holds all the items received by a supplier, with unique codes. The user is also capable of changing their quantities before uploading the Pallet to the database and applying the stock changes. 

Additionally, there is also a feature to display all the stored Pallets, together with their time, date, name of the supplier, and the unique code for the Pallet. When a pallet is selected, it also displays the items held by it, according to the updated database. 


# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
